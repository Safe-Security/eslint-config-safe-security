This package provides Safe-Security' .eslintrc as a shareable config

## Installation

Refer [Updated Repository](https://github.com/Safe-Security/eslint-config-safe-security)

```shell
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-lucideus
```

- Confirm usage of `yarn`, if prompted

## Usage

Once you install the `eslint-config-safe-security` package and all its peer dependencies, you can start using all the rules by specifying it in your eslint config file within the `extends` section of your `.eslintrc.json` file

```json
{
    "extends": ["eslint-config-safe-security"]
}
```

### Setup in a React project

React specific rules are added separately along with the base rules. You can simply include it within your project using the `eslint-config-safe-security/react` rule set within the `extends` section

```json
{
    "extends": ["eslint-config-safe-security", "eslint-config-safe-security/react"]
}
```

### Setup in a AWS CDK project

All typescript rules compatible with the AWS CDK structure have been added separately and can be integrated by using the following configuration

```json
{
    "extends": ["eslint-config-safe-security", "eslint-config-safe-security/cdk"]
}
```

## Running the linter

Add the following to your `package.json` within the `scripts` section to have an easy to use command:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint": "./node_modules/.bin/eslint src"
    }
}
```

Now you can run, using `npm run lint` OR `yarn lint`
